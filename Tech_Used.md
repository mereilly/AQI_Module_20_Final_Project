# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas and Requests will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis from data gathered on APIs. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
AWS RDS is the database we intend to use managed through pgAdmin. Although we are also prepared to switch to a different format should colaboration prove to be difficult under this method.

## Machine Learning
We will use the RandomForestClassifier from the sklearn ML library to create a supervised learning classifier. We will then use metrics from the sklearn to test the accuracy of of the classifier using test and predicted data samples from the split data base. We plan to visualize the initial results through the seaborn library. 

## Dashboard
We hope to incorporate this information into a visualizations made on Tableau which we can export for a great presentation.
